Project Euler in Rust
-------------------------------------
###Aim

To learn the Rust Programming Language with the aid of Project Euler problems.

###Compilation and Running

All solutions are written and updated for the latest stable Rust release on Windows: [Version 0.9](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Using-Rust-on-Windows "Link to Rust's Windows installer guide")
 
To compile and run the solutions, first follow [Rust's Quick Start guide](https://github.com/mozilla/rust "Link to Rust's Quick Start guide on github") on Github and install Rust for your corresponding system from [Rust's Official Website](http://www.rust-lang.org/ "Rust's Official Website").

After you have installed Rust:


1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/listless/Project-Euler-in-Rust.git`
2. cd into the directory `cd Project-Euler-in-Rust`
3. Compile the example using Rust's compiler `rustc "Problem xxx.rs"`
4. Run the executable

###FAQ
<i>These solutions are poor!  I know better solutions!</i>

I would gladly like to see other solutions to these problems in Rust!  As I'm still learning, my take on the solutions may be pretty amateurish, so I'm very open to learning better ways of solving these problems in Rust!

<i>Why did you do `this` or `that`? It's unnecessary / inefficient / incorrect!</i>

If you come across anything that seems wrong or badly implemented, please make an [issue](https://github.com/listless/Project-Euler-in-Rust/issues "Link to this Repository's Issue Tracker page")!  
I'd be very grateful to learn more about Rust, programming and problem solving!

###Project Euler and Rust
- [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/ "Project Euler's Official Website")

>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

>The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

- [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/ "Rust's Official Website")

>Rust is a curly-brace, block-structured expression language. It visually resembles the C language family, but differs significantly in syntactic and semantic details. Its design is oriented toward concerns of gprogramming in the largeh, that is, of creating and maintaining boundaries ? both abstract and operational ? that preserve large-system  integrity, availability and concurrency. 

> It supports a mixture of imperative procedural, concurrent actor, object-oriented and pure functional styles. Rust also supports generic programming and metaprogramming, in both static and dynamic styles.
